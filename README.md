The website for Farm To Table Cafe/Restaurant is designed with a minimalistic approach, making it easy for customers to navigate. On opening the website, customers are greeted with a small slideshow of images of the restaurant, along with its logo prominently displayed at the top. As customers scroll down the page, they are presented with a flipbook-style menu that allows them to easily browse through the different dishes on offer. Following the menu, there is an About us section as well as a QR code for customers to make payments with ease. Finally, at the bottom of the website, there is a link to the restaurant's location on Google Maps, along with its contact details and social media links, so customers can stay informed about the latest happenings at the establishment. The website also has a section for ordering food online via popular platforms such as Swiggy and Zomato.
